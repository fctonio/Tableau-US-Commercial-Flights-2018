## Project Description
The goal of this project was to find a dataset and tell a story using tableau to visualize the data.

## Dataset
The Dataset: "2018" is a CSV file which I downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018
It contains every single national US commercial flight that took place in the year 2018. It contains a lot of columns with all imaginable information about each flight. I specifically used the following colomns: <br>
1 - OP_CARRIER<br>
2 - ORIGIN<br>
3 - DEST<br>
4 - DEP_DELAY<br>
5 - CANCELLED<br>

## Workflow

- I love the aviation sector and knew that if I find a dataset in that sector it would be very clean and complete, because of the regulations in that sector. It didn't take me very long to find a beautiful dataset on Kaggle. It contained mor than 7 million rows, representing each and every commercial flight in the US during 2018.
- Since the Dataset actualy came from the BTS website (Bureau of Transportation Statistics) it was not only complet but also very accurate, since it are the official information from the pilots and airlines. I had no cleaning to do or what so ever.
- I then came up with a few questions a I wanted to answer and started drafting a way answer my questions with a visualization.
- Once I had an idea of what I wanted to represent I only had to execute it... Easier said then done. I encountered some very basic problems, as creating a selecting filter or having to think of a way to program a calculaive field to represent what I wanted.
_ I finished of by including all my Dashboards/Worksheets into a story and commenting every story page with a little context.

## Organization
In the repository you will find several files and a Folder:<br>
<br>
1 - .gitignore -> To not push everything.<br>
2 - README.md -> That would be this beautiful file :P<br>
2 - Data (Folder) -> containing the 2018.csv file file<br>
